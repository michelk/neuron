title: Images in Zettels

Absolute paths or URIs to image-file will just work. E.g.

```markdown

![Rose](/home/user/img/rose.png)

![Image alt-text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3998/79054336-ec5c9480-7c11-11ea-885e-c67926d28acc.png)
```

But if you want to put an image directly into the zettelkasten directory and
link to it with relative path, this won't work, since the output directory usually
changes to `.neuron/output` and the images are not copied.

Instead, you need to put them into a directory called `static`. This directory
will be copied _as is_ into the output folder. E.g.

```markdown
![Rose](./static/rose.png)
```
