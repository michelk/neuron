title: Zettel metadata
---

Your zettels can contain custom metadata. Besides "title", Neuron supports the
optional fields "tags", "author" and "date" as builtins. 

With "tag", you can query your zettels; "author" and "date" are annotated at
the bottom of the page.

For example:

```markdown
---
title: Gravity
tags:
  - science
---
```

Tags can also be nested using a "tag/subtag" syntax, to allow a more fine-grained organization of your Zettelkasten, especially when using advanced queries as shown in [2011506](zcf://linking-to-multiple-zettels).
